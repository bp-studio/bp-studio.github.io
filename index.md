## Introduction

Box pleating is arguably the standard framework of modern super-complex origami designs,
as the creases are much more predictable and manageable than those found in the traditional 22.5 degree system or circle packing.
Although pure box pleating is well-known for not being very efficient in utilizing paper area,
with the help of stretching gadgets (such as Kamiya patterns and the more generalized GOPS),
it is now possible for box pleating to achieve efficiency nearly as good as the optimal circle packing.
This app is created to help origami designers to blueprint their models in such systems.
