# BP Studio website

This is the source for the BP Studio website at [bp-studio.github.io](https://bp-studio.github.io).

## Running locally

If you want to run this website locally, you need to:

1. Install [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/).
2. Run `bundle install` to install dependencies.
   Could take like 30 minutes or so on the first installation,
   as it takes time to compile dependencies.
3. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve`.

The site will then be available at [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000).
