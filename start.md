# Getting started

## Prerequisites

Box Pleating Studio is not for origami beginners.
In order to fully understand the pattern it creates and be able to fold it,
you must be considerably familiar with the theory of uniaxial box pleating bases.
You will find everything you need to know in Chapter 13 and 14 of Robert J. Lang's remarkable book
(See [[1]](notes.html#b1) in the bibliography section).

## How to get the app

Simply visit [https://bpstudio.abstreamace.com/](https://bpstudio.abstreamace.com/)
to launch the BP Studio app, no downloading required!
For the best performance, it is highly recommended that you use Chrome to visit the site.
In any case, do update your browser to the latest version,
as BP Studio utilizes many new web features and will not work on legacy browsers.

If you visit the website by Chrome (on devices other than iPhone), Edge (on desktops), or Safari (on an iPhone),
it will also inform you that you could install BP Studio to your device as a standalone app, and use it offline.
Just follow the instructions to install it.
This will provide the best user experience especially on mobile devices.
