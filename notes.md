## Acknowledgement

The author would like to specially thank the following people, in no particular ordering:
- Robert J. Lang for his work that inspired the idea of GOPS,
and for his continuing support and encouragement throughout these years.
- JÃ¼rg Lehni and Jonathan Puckey, for creating [paper.js](http://paperjs.org/),
the powerful and efficient vector graphics library that powers BP Studio.
- Lucas Tay Kiat Loong, for so eagerly volunteering to test BP Studio,
helping catching many critical and subtle bugs, and providing many invaluable feedbacks.

## About the author

Mu-Tsun Tsai began his studying of origami design theory by reading Robert J. Lang's book.
They soon became good friends and together they generalized the notion of Pythagorean Stretch into GOPS,
and it was published in 7OSME.
Tsai lives in Taiwan and makes a living by doing full-stack developing.
He particularly specializes in C# and TypeScript.
Tsai is also the author of the reactive framework Shrewd,
which is the core powering Box Pleating Studio.
