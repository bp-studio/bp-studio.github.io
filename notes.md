## Acknowledgement

The author would like to specially thank the following people/parties, in no particular ordering:

- [Robert J. Lang](https://langorigami.com/) for his work that inspired the idea of GOPS,
and for his continuing support and encouragement throughout these years.
- [Lucas Tay Kiat Loong](https://cexplr.github.io/), for so eagerly volunteering to test BP Studio,
helping catching many critical and subtle bugs, and providing many invaluable feedbacks.
- [Jason S. Ku](https://github.com/origamimagiro), for his insights on the subject of computational geometry.
- Mat Groves and [GoodBoyDigital](https://www.goodboydigital.com), for maintaining [PixiJS](https://pixijs.com/),
the graphics engine that powers BP Studio.
- [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/), for enrolling BP Studio into its Open Source Program.
It would be financially impossible for BP Studio to perform compatibility tests without it.

## About the author

Mu-Tsun Tsai began his studying of origami design theory by reading Robert J. Lang's book.
They soon became good friends and together they generalized the notion of Pythagorean Stretch into GOPS,
and it was published in 7OSME.
Tsai lives in Taiwan and makes a living by doing full-stack developing.
He particularly specializes in C# and TypeScript.
He is also a major contributor of the [Oriedita](https://oriedita.github.io/) project.
